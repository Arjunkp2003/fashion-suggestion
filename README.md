Project Description: Fashion Dress Suggestion System
This project is a Fashion Dress Suggestion System that provides outfit recommendations based on an uploaded image. The system is built and deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to easily interact with it through a web interface.

Key Features and Technologies Used:
Image-based Recommendations: The system allows users to upload an image of a fashion item, and it suggests similar outfits by comparing image features.
ResNet50 Model: The core of the system is a pre-trained ResNet50 model, which is used to extract meaningful features from the uploaded image. ResNet50 is a deep learning model known for its high accuracy in image recognition tasks, and it has been fine-tuned for fashion-related features in this project.
Nearest Neighbors Algorithm: To suggest similar fashion items, the Nearest Neighbors algorithm is employed. It finds the most similar items by calculating the Euclidean distance between the feature vectors of the uploaded image and pre-stored fashion images. The system retrieves the top 5 most similar items.
Streamlit Deployment: The project is deployed via Streamlit, a popular framework for creating interactive web applications with minimal code. Users can upload images and receive fashion suggestions in real-time.
How It Works:
Users upload an image of a fashion item they want suggestions for.
The image is processed by the ResNet50 model to extract its features.
These features are compared to a pre-stored set of image features using the Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
The top 5 most similar items are displayed as fashion suggestions.
